For the project, students will be asked to create the institutional website of an imaginary company. This company will provide a product or service linked to the query student will aim at ranking for. The details of the query students will aim for and the specifics of the website will be shared during the first session of the Kick-Off. This website will have to be linked to Google tools like Google Tag Manager, Google Search Console and Google Analytics.

Then, once their website is up and running, students will use the knowledge acquired during the other Kick-Off sessions to improve on their website, both on the editorial and technical aspects. They will also go through an auditing process of their own website halfway through the module, and implement the recommendations they will make.

Finally, the end goal of their website will be to rank the highest for the specified query, while being in competition with their fellow classmates.
